## Introduction
Welcome to Henna, my Milestone Project 4 for the Level 5 Diploma in Full Stack Web Application Development! This project will demonstrate my full-stack web development skills by creating a seamless and user-friendly platform for booking henna services and purchasing henna products.

### Colour Scheme
![henna-coolors](documentation/images/design/henna2.png)
For the Henna web application, I’ve selected a streamlined colour scheme to ensure both style and readability:

#### **Primary Colour**

- **Deep Burgundy (#6D4C53)**
  - *Usage:* Main accents, buttons, links.
  - *Reason:* Offers a rich and elegant appearance, perfect for highlighting key elements.

#### **Secondary Colour**

- **Warm Sand (#D4A78D)**
  - *Usage:* Backgrounds, cards, and highlights.
  - *Reason:* Provides a warm, neutral backdrop that complements the primary colour and creates a calming effect.

#### **Accent Colour**

- **Golden Ochre (#F6C857)**
  - *Usage:* Call-to-action buttons, highlights, and active elements.
  - *Reason:* Adds a vibrant contrast that draws attention to important actions and features.

#### **Supporting Colours**

- **Soft Olive (#9B8A5B)** and **Charcoal Grey (#4A4A4A)**
  - *Usage:* Secondary buttons, text, and subtle details.
  - *Reason:* Enhances contrast and readability without overpowering the primary palette.

#### **Background Colour**

- **Light Beige (#F9F7F1)**
  - *Usage:* Main background.
  - *Reason:* Ensures a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that enhances overall readability.

### Typography

I’ve selected five different fonts for the Henna web application to achieve a visually appealing and functional design that enhances the user experience. Each font has a specific role: 

- **[Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display)** adds elegance to headings.
![playfair-display](documentation/images/design/playfair-display.png)

- **[Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora)** provides readability for body text.
![lora](documentation/images/design/lora.png)

## UML Use Case Diagram

I have created the UML Use Case Diagram to depict how different types of users and administrators interact with the system. The diagram features actors such as New Visitor, Registered User (including Returning User and Frequent User), and Admin. It outlines essential functionalities like browsing products, managing services and orders, processing payments, and handling user accounts. I have used `<<include>>` to show mandatory interactions and `<<extend>>` for optional ones, providing a clear overview of how these components are connected.

Below is the diagram image for a visual representation:

## Database

For development, I utilised the SQLite3 database, as it is the default option for Django projects and is straightforward to set up in a development environment. When the site moves to Heroku, I will switch to PostgreSQL, provided by Code Institute. PostgreSQL is better suited for production, delivering enhanced performance, scalability, and efficient management of larger datasets and multiple users.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for this project provides a clear representation of the database structure. It shows how key entities such as users, roles, profiles, services, products, orders, bookings, and reviews are related to each other. The diagram helps define how data will be organised and managed within the application, ensuring smooth operation and scalability.

The ERD includes the following relationships:

- **User - Role (Many-to-One):** Multiple users can have the same role, which defines their permissions and access levels, such as regular user, owner, or admin.

- **User - Profile (One-to-One):** Each user can have one profile that stores personal details. However, having a profile is optional for some roles, like admins.

- **User - Address (One-to-Many):** A user can have several addresses, which could be used for billing, shipping, or service locations.

- **User - Booking (One-to-Many):** A user can make multiple bookings, allowing them to book various services over time.

- **User - Order (One-to-Many):** A user can place multiple orders, with each order potentially containing several items.

- **User - LoyaltyPoint (One-to-One):** Each user has a single set of loyalty points, which they earn through bookings or purchases.

- **Order - OrderItem (One-to-Many):** An order can contain several items, representing individual products included in that order.

- **OrderItem - Product (Many-to-One):** Many order items can be linked to a single product, associating products with specific orders.

- **Booking - Service (Many-to-One):** Multiple bookings can refer to the same service, allowing users to book a particular service multiple times.

- **Review - User (Many-to-One):** A user can write several reviews, offering feedback on different services or products.

- **Review - Service (Many-to-One):** Many reviews can refer to a single service, allowing users to share their experiences with the same service.

- **Review - Product (Many-to-One, Nullable):** Several reviews can refer to a single product, although this connection is optional, especially when reviews apply to services instead of products.

This ERD ensures that the database is well-structured to handle user management, service bookings, order processing, and reviews, while also supporting features like loyalty programmes and role-based access. The design is intended to maintain efficiency and scalability as the application grows.

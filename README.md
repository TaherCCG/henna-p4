## Introduction
Welcome to Henna, my Milestone Project 4 for the Level 5 Diploma in Full Stack Web Application Development! This project will demonstrate my full-stack web development skills by creating a seamless and user-friendly platform for booking henna services and purchasing henna products.

## Objective
The main aim of Henna is to offer a seamless, intuitive, and engaging experience for clients looking to book henna services and buy henna products. The application uses modern web technologies to provide a dynamic solution that meets both personal and commercial needs.

## Key Features

- **User Management:** Allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts easily.

- **Service Booking:** Enables users to browse, select, and book henna services with real-time availability.

- **Product Purchasing:** Offers a detailed catalogue of henna products, with features to add items to a cart and proceed through a secure checkout process.

- **Secure Payments:** Integrates Stripe for safe and efficient payment handling.

- **Media Storage:** Utilises Amazon S3 for reliable and scalable storage of media files, such as images of henna designs and product photos.

- **Admin Panel:** Provides administrators with tools to manage service listings, product inventories, and user accounts.

### Colour Scheme
![henna-coolors](documentation/images/design/henna2.png)
For the Henna web application, I’ve selected a streamlined colour scheme to ensure both style and readability:

#### **Primary Colour**

- **Deep Burgundy (#6D4C53)**
  - *Usage:* Main accents, buttons, links.
  - *Reason:* Offers a rich and elegant appearance, perfect for highlighting key elements.

#### **Secondary Colour**

- **Warm Sand (#D4A78D)**
  - *Usage:* Backgrounds, cards, and highlights.
  - *Reason:* Provides a warm, neutral backdrop that complements the primary colour and creates a calming effect.

#### **Accent Colour**

- **Golden Ochre (#F6C857)**
  - *Usage:* Call-to-action buttons, highlights, and active elements.
  - *Reason:* Adds a vibrant contrast that draws attention to important actions and features.

#### **Supporting Colours**

- **Soft Olive (#9B8A5B)** and **Charcoal Grey (#4A4A4A)**
  - *Usage:* Secondary buttons, text, and subtle details.
  - *Reason:* Enhances contrast and readability without overpowering the primary palette.

#### **Background Colour**

- **Light Beige (#F9F7F1)**
  - *Usage:* Main background.
  - *Reason:* Ensures a clean, unobtrusive backdrop that enhances overall readability.

### Typography

I’ve selected five different fonts for the Henna web application to achieve a visually appealing and functional design that enhances the user experience. Each font has a specific role: 

- **[Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display)** adds elegance to headings.

- **[Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora)** provides readability for body text.

- **[Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway)** offers a modern touch for subheadings and UI elements.

- **[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)** ensures clarity and accessibility for general content.

## UML Use Case Diagram

I have created the UML Use Case Diagram to depict how different types of users and administrators interact with the system. The diagram features actors such as New Visitor, Registered User (including Returning User and Frequent User), and Admin. It outlines essential functionalities like browsing products, managing services and orders, processing payments, and handling user accounts. I have used `<<include>>` to show mandatory interactions and `<<extend>>` for optional ones, providing a clear overview of how these components are connected.

Below is the diagram image for a visual representation:

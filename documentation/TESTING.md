## Initial Setup Testing

Before commencing full-scale development, I conducted an initial test to verify the correct setup of the Django application. This step ensured that the development environment was configured correctly and that the Django server could be launched without errors.

### Steps Performed

1. **Running the Django Development Server**:
   - Command used:
     ```bash
     python3 manage.py runserver
     ```
   - Verified that the server started successfully without errors.

2. **Accessing the Application**:
   - Checked the application by visiting `https://8000-taherccg-hennap4-4telli2ywmt.ws.codeinstitute-ide.net/` in a web browser.

### Results

The Django development server started without issues, and the application was accessible at `https://8000-taherccg-hennap4-4telli2ywmt.ws.codeinstitute-ide.net/`, confirming that the environment setup was successful.
